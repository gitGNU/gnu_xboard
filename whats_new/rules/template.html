  <h3>Pawn peculiarities</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Pawns capture differently from how they move (straight
    move, diagonal capture).</li>

    <li>Pawns can move two squares ahead from their initial
    position, provided they are not blocked.</li>

    <li>On the move immediately after such a double push, they can
    be captured en passant by another Pawn, as if they had only
    moved 1 square ahead.</li>

    <li>Pawns promote to another (non-royal) piece of choice when
    they reach last rank.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Castling</h3>

  <p>A King that has not moved before can move two squares in the
  direction of a Rook that has not moved before, in which case that
  Rook is moved to the square the King skipped over. This is only
  allowed when the King is not in check, on the square it came from
  and would not be in check on the square it skipped over.</p>

  <h3>General rules</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>It is not allowed to expose your King to check.</li>

    <li>The game is won by checkmating the opponent's King.</li>

    <li>Stalemate (no legal moves, but not in check) is a
    draw.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Differences with FIDE</h3>

  <p>None.</p>

  <h3>Strategy issues</h3>

  <p>It is not possible to force checkmate on a bare King with just
  a single Bishop or Knight (in addition to your own King).</p>

  <p>Bishops are confined to squares of a single color. Having
  Bishops on both colors compensates this weakness, and is worth an
  extra 0.5 on top of their added value.</p>

  <p>As Chancellor and Queen are nearly equal in value to Queen,
  under-promotion is very common.</p>
