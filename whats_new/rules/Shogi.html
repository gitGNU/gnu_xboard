  <h1>Shogi (Japanese Chess)</h1>

  <p>Shogi (literally meaning 'Generals Game') is highly popular in
  Japan, and is the World's third major Chess variant, after
  Xiangqi and FIDE. Draws hardly occur, because there rule that
  captured pieces can be dropped back on the board ensures the game
  can go on until a decision is reached. Historically, it are these
  piece drops that have won the game its popularity; the dropless
  version, Sho Shogi (= small Shogi) was overwhelmed in popularity
  by the also dropless Chu Shogi (= middle Shogi).</p>

  <h3>Pawn peculiarities</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Pawns move <b>and capture</b> straight ahead.</li>

    <li>It is forbidded to have more than one Pawn in the same
    file.</li>

    <li>It is forbidden to checkmate the opponent with a Pawn
    drop.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>General rules</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>The game is won by capturing the opponent's King.</li>

    <li>Pieces captured change color, and are kept in hand by the
    side who captured them. In stead of a normal move, such pieces
    can be dropped at any later time.</li>

    <li>Pieces cannot be moved or dropped to a location where all
    their moves would go off board.</li>

    <li>Pieces promote at the end of a move into, in or out of the
    promotion zone.</li>

    <li>The promotion zone consists of the last three ranks.</li>

    <li>Pieces obtained by promotion revert to their original form
    on capture.</li>

    <li>Perpetual checking is forbidden, and would be ruled a loss
    on the 4-fold repeat.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>XBoard interface issues</h3>

  <p>You can drop pieces by dragging them onto the board from the
  holdings displayed beside the board.</p>

  <p>Of course there will always be people that prefer an oriental
  look, with pentagonal kanji tiles. XBoard comes with a set of
  kanji pieces in the 'themes/shogi' sub-directory of its data
  directory (e.g. /usr/local/share/games/xboard). You can select
  that as -pieceImageDirectory (-pid for short) from the command
  line, or from the View -&gt; Board dialog. You would also have to
  tick 'Flip black pieces Shogi style' there (or use the option
  <b>-flipBlack true</b>) to make sure the pieces won't go upside
  down when you flip the view.</p>

  <h3>Differences with FIDE</h3>

  <p>In stead of Queens you have Silver and Gold Generals, and
  Lances. The Knight only has the two forward-most moves of a FIDE
  Knight. Pawns capture straight ahead. Captured pieces can later
  be dropped to augment the army of their capturer. There is no
  castling, Pawn double-push or e.p. capture. Other pieces than
  Pawns also promote. The promotion zone is three ranks deep in
  stead of one.</p>

  <h3>Strategy issues</h3>

  <p>Because pieces are dropped back, there will not be a
  traditional end-game. Trading material does not constitute
  progress towards winning, even when you are ahead.</p>

  <p>Because Gold Generals obtained through promotion revert to
  their original form on capture, they are really different piece
  types from the primordial Golds that move the same. In notation
  they are therefore not indicated as 'G', but as the ID of the
  original piece prefixed with a '+'. Especially the promoted Pawn
  (aka Tokin) is more valuable: it is much better to lose a Gold
  that gives the opponent a Pawn in hand, than to lose a Gold that
  gives him a Gold in hand.</p>

  <p>Most pieces are quite slow, or not manoeuvrable at all, and
  their practical value is very dependent on how far they are from
  the Kings.</p>

  <p>Pieces in hand are in general worth more than on the board, as
  they are much more mobile. And you can drop them in the promotion
  for an easy promotion on the next turn. But pieces in hand cannot
  capture anything, and don't guard your promotion zone.</p>
