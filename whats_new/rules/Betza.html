  <h1>Extended Betza notation</h1>

  <p>Ralph Betza invented a compact notation to encode moves of a
  piece, which is now in wide-spread use for description of Chess
  variants. This page describes a version of it that has been
  extended in several ways. Some of these extensions were embraced
  from another proposed extension scheme, '<span style=
  "background: #00FFFF;">Bex notation</span>' by David Howe, others
  are entirely new. These new extensions from the original Betza
  notation are <span style="background: yellow;">marked in
  yellow</span>.</p>

  <p>Betza notation decomposes the piece into 'atoms', which
  represent the set of all (8-fold-)symmetry-equivalent moves of a
  certain distance. For example all eight Knight moves, or all
  diagonal moves of the King. Each 'atom' is written as a single
  capital (e.g. N for the Knight moves), which is very efficient
  when you are dealing with pieces that are maximally symmetric
  (which most pieces indeed are). Atoms refer to single unblockable
  leaps of a certain distance. Pieces that can repeat the same leap
  again and again until they encounter an obstacle (sliders or
  riders, such as Rook) are very common. Those moves are indicated
  by writing the number of steps the piece can maximally make
  behind the atom, <span style="background: yellow;">where '0' can
  be used to indicate 'any number of steps'</span>.</p>

  <p>The choice to treat moves as sets that go in all directions
  goes at the expense of the compactness when dealing with
  asymmetric pieces. (This is a cheap price to pay, as asymmetric
  pieces are much less common than fully symmetric ones.) To
  describe moves of asymmetric pieces Betza notation uses
  <i>lower-case prefixes</i> to identify which sub-set of the atom
  we mean. Such as f (forward) or r (right), or combinarions of
  those like fr. E.g. fR decribes a 'Rook' that only moves in the
  forward direction (i.e., the Shogi Lance). Lower-case prefixes
  are also used to specify the move is not a general one (i.e.
  valid as capture and non-capture, the normal situation in
  Chess-like games), but can only be used in limited ways (e.g.
  capture only, non-jumping, capture after jumping).</p>

  <p>For longer-range atoms no letters are defined. In the rare
  cases they occur, <span style="background: #00FFFF;">these can be
  written using the numeric coordinates of their leap
  vector</span>, e.g. (4,1) for the Giraffe leap. Note this still
  implies the move goes in all directions (i.e. (4,1) also means
  (4,-1), (-4,1), (1,4), ...), and thus still does a lot for
  compactness. A piece that only leaps 4 forward and 1 left or
  right would be an f(4,1).</p>

  <h3>Modifier prefixes</h3>

  <p>The following table lists possible prefixes to the atoms.
  Prefixes can be combined, in which case the sub-sets of move
  types they correspond to are joined. E.g. fb means forward
  <i>and</i> backward moves (but not sideways). So even prefixes
  with opposite meaning are not really conflicting; they could be
  superfluous, however. (E.g. mc would mean both non-capture and
  capture, which is the default in absence of prefixes anyway.)</p>

  <p>For example, fmWfcF is a Pawn: non-captures forward to a W
  square, captures to the two forward F squares. Pretty
  complicated, but the Pawn is a very complex piece (asymmetric,
  and divergent capture/non-capture). Note that fr and rf are not
  the same on 'oblique' (= not orthogonal or diagonal) atoms, which
  have 8 moves, and that they might not be what you intuitively
  think, as fs = fl + fr.</p>

  <h3>Grouping</h3>

  <p><span style="background: #00FFFF;">Grouping of atoms,
  modifiers and exponents is possible with parentheses</span>. This
  can be done for readability, or for overruling operator
  priorities. (fmW)(fcF) might read more easily than fmWfcF. The
  parentheses do not have any meaning in themselves.
  'Distributivity' also works for modifier prefixes: m(AB) where m
  is a string of modifiers and A and B are atoms, (or expressions
  grouped in parentheses), is defined to mean mAmB. Some shortcuts
  for commonly used combinations of atoms exist; these can be seen
  as implicit grouping of the involved atoms.</p>

  <h3>Chaining moves</h3>

  <p>When a number of atoms is concatenated, like WF, it joins
  their move sets. So the piece described by WF moves either as W
  or as F, i.e. one step diagonal, or one step orthogonal. That
  means it is the King of orthodox Chess! (From the notation you
  cannot see whether it is royal yet; the main purpose of the
  notation is to convey how it moves. <span style=
  "background-color: yellow;">But a 'k' prefix could be used to
  indicate royalty</span>, when this is of relevance.)</p>

  <p>It is also possible to specify that certain moves have to be
  performed sequentially, one after the other. For instance because
  something of importance happens or should be noted on an
  intermediate square. Such as for pieces that can be blocked on
  squares they cannot visit ('lame leapers'), or that have to hop
  over other pieces in a specific pattern. The simplest example of
  this, however, is repetition of the same step in the same
  direction, as in sliding or riding pieces, such as a Rook. The
  far moves of such a piece can indeed be blocked by an obstacle
  closer by on their path, although it can then always reach that
  square itself as well. Such moves are indicated by
  'exponentiation': a number after the atom indicates how often the
  step may be repeated. E.g. F3 would be a piece that slides
  diagonally (i.e. like a Bishop), upto a maximum of 3 steps. To
  indicate an arbitrary number of steps can be taken, we use 0
  (zero) for the exponent. (This because infinity is not in the
  ASCII character set, and 0 would be pointless when taken at face
  value.) So W0 would be the Rook, sliding arbitrarily far
  orthogonally, and F0 the Bishop. (Old notation for this would be
  WW and FF, but in the extended context these would be
  troublesome.)</p>Not all multi-step moves are as regular as
  simple sliders, however. Some 'bent' sliders can turn corners,
  for instance. The 'Griffon' is an example that first moves one
  step diagonally, and <b>then</b> continues outward as a Rook. It
  does not have to go beyond the corner, though; just like a normal
  Rook it can make the first step of its move only. And if it
  encounters something on that first step, it is blocked, and never
  gets to the rooky part of its move. To describe this trajectory
  we cannot use exponentiation, but have to explicitly write the
  chain: FtR. Here the 't' is the chaining operator, that
  distinguishes this from FR, which would mean a piece that steps
  one diagonally <b>or</b> moves like Rook (a Shogi Dragon Horse).
  The 't' is because of 'and <b>t</b>hen', but also because the
  move could be <b>t</b>erminated at that point, and there is no
  requirement to visit the later parts of the specified trajectory.

  <p>There are other forms of chaining, where the 'connecting
  square' can not be visited. (I.e. no termination there.) The
  Xiangqi Horse moves one orthogonal step, and then (without
  stopping) one step diagonally outward, mimicking the move of a
  Knight, but blockable on the intermediate square. This is written
  as the chain W-F. The chaining operator '-' indicates the move
  cannot be terminated at that point (ending on the connection
  square), but must continue. If it cannot, because the square was
  occupied, the move described by the chain is considered blocked,
  and cannot be made.</p>

  <p>Chaining implies continuation in the most similar direction.
  Should you need to deviate from that, e.g. because the trajectory
  doubles back on itself, directional modifiers must be used. The
  continuation steps are to be described in a coordinate system
  relative to the previous step, however. So W-rW-lW makes one
  step, (say moving North), then turns right for another step
  (moving East), and then turns left compared to that second step,
  meaning it is moving North again! So in the end you arrive at
  (1,2), over (0,1) and (1,1). This is a Knight move that can only
  be made if both the intermediate squares are empty, even worse
  than the Xiangqi Horse (which at least did not care about (1,1))!
  The latter would be described by W-F. The F after '-' would by
  default mean fF, and in the orientation of the preceding
  orthogonal step this would imply a pair of outward moves, fl +
  fr.</p>

  <p>Some examples that use the other operators: Q+K is the
  Grasshopper: it must move as Queen to an occupied square (the
  'support'), (the first one it encounters, as Queens do not
  jump!), and then continue with a single K step in the same
  direction (leaving the occupant of the square alone), to land on
  the square directly behind the support. where it can capture or
  just move. mRcR+R is the Xiangqi Cannon: the first mR specifies
  its non-capture move, which is that of a normal Rook. The
  concatenated cR+R is the capturing alternative; it moves as R to
  an occupied square, and then continues as R in the same direction
  for a capture. Note that the 'c' prefix applies to the complete
  R+R path (a once jumping Rook); the operator priorities are such
  that the binary operators t-+xdy couple more tightly than the
  prefix modifiers mc. The latter are only allowed in front of a
  complete path, to specify what you can do at the end of it, and
  not on individual steps of the path, where the chaining operators
  already specify this.</p>

  <h3>Weird captures</h3>

  <p>The x operator allows description of pieces with
  unconventional capture, as it specifies moving away from the
  capture square. Normal in Chess is of course that you only
  captured what was on the square you end on. But even in orthodox
  Chess e.p. capture exists as an exception to that. It could be
  written as frmWxlW, which, as we have seen, means frm(WxlW) This
  expreses capture through a W step, and then turning left for a
  second W step, so that overall you make an F step in an L form.
  The frm prefix to this F step means that it can not capture <i>on
  the final square</i> (the Pawn in e.p. capture always goes to an
  empty square), to your forward right. I.e. you started moving
  right, then turned left to move forward. So the continuation
  square you pass over to remove the Pawn is to your right. (There
  is no way to express that you can only do this to Pawns, however,
  let alone to Pawns that just made a double push.)</p>

  <p>This shows the general encoding strategy: if you capture
  pieces not on your destination square, as 'side effect' to the
  move, you lay out a path that tramples all the pieces that are
  captured, so that the sub-steps are all normal replacement
  captures. E.g. a Checker would be fmFfmFxF. There the fmF part is
  the non-capture move, but the interesting part is the capture:
  one step diagonal (which must be to an occupied square, which we
  capture), and then straight on (which is now 'forward' in the
  local frame of reference set up by the first step) to the next
  square, for an overall A step. This step must be fmA, i.e. in one
  of the forward diagonal directions, not capturing anything on the
  square where it lands. 'Rifle capture' by a Rook would be RxebR,
  i.e. first capture something in the normal way, and then
  manditorily withdraw in the direction from which you came (b) by
  an R move of the same length. No overall move, but the victim is
  gone! A Ultima Withdrawer, which destroys the adjacent piece from
  which it moves away, would be written as mQmKxbK-Q. The capture
  part, m(KxbK-Q) specifies capture to the adjacent piece,
  reversing that step (b) to your square of origin, and then
  mandatorily continuing in that direction with a Queen non-capture
  move (the victim already in your pocket). The hit-and-run or
  double capture of a Lion would be KxaK: capture the adjacent
  piece, after which you must continue by another King step in any
  direction relative to the first, capturing a second victim or
  just moving. ven the rifle capture (igui) is included in this.
  Its turn-passing move would be K-bK. Which is different from O,
  because it can only be done if the Lion is adacent to an empty
  square, while a piece that has an O atom can pass uncondiionally.
  For definiteness, when directional modifiers apply to a path that
  results in a return to the starting square, they will be
  referenced to the direction of the first step of the path.</p>

  <h3>More about exponentiation</h3>

  <p>Exponentiation by default implies repeated application of the
  't' operator. But it can be used to indicate repeate application
  of other operators too. <span style="background: #FFFF00;">We
  define AmN, with A an atom or a group within parentheses, m a
  string of modifiers, and N a number, to mean AmAmAm...mA with N
  factors A and N-1 operators between them</span>. If the modifier
  string m does not contain one of the chaining operators, it is
  prefixed with the default 't'. If it does not include any
  directional modifiers, it is suffixed with 'f'. So W3 means
  WtfWtfW, 1 to 3 orthogonal steps in the same direction (which is
  what the 'f' specifies). But W-3 would mean W-fW-fW, which is
  exactly 3 such steps. And Wx3 would be exactly 3 steps where the
  first 2 mandatorily capture.</p>

  <p>By including directonal indicators, you can describe curved
  trajectories. Nrf8 would mean NtrfNtrfN..., upto 8 Knight moves,
  each consecutive move bending ~45 degrees right from the previous
  one (because that is what rf means; the first opportnity to the
  right that is not straight ahead). This describes the Rose!
  Circular riders fit into the system, and there is no need for a
  separate prefix to describe them. With grouping you can do more:
  (FtlF)r0 expands to FtlFtrFtlFtrFtl..., an arbitrary number of
  diagonal steps, that alternately turn 90 degrees left or right.
  In other words, the Crooked Bishop. There is also no real need
  for the z prefix in this extended Betza notation. The
  exponentiation can describe it much more precisely, specifying
  exactly how Crooked it is.</p>
