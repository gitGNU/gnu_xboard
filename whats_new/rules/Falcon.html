  <h3>Pawn peculiarities</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Pawns capture differently from how they move (straight
    move, diagonal capture).</li>

    <li>Pawns can move two squares ahead from their initial
    position, provided they are not blocked.</li>

    <li>On the move immediately after such a double push, they can
    be captured en passant by another Pawn, as if they had only
    moved 1 square ahead.</li>

    <li>Pawns promote to another (non-royal) piece of choice when
    they reach last rank.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Castling</h3>

  <p>A King that has not moved before can move <b>three</b> steps
  in the direction of a Rook that has not moved before, in which
  case that Rook is moved to the square next to the King on the
  other side. This is only allowed if all squares between King and
  Rook are empty, when the King is not in check on the square it
  came from, and would not be in check on any of the squares it
  skipped over.</p>

  <h3>The Falcon piece</h3>

  <p>The Falcon is a so-called multi-path piece. It complements the
  moves of all orthodox pieces, in the sense that it can reaches
  all squares reachable by King could reach in 3 moves that cannot
  be reached by R, B or N in a single move. A King would always
  need three steps to reach the Falcon destinations, (one diagonal
  and two straight, or two diagonal and one straight), but it can
  always do so in three ways, depending on the order of the
  straight and diagonal steps. The Falcon must follow the path a
  King could have followed, and if all the three paths are blocked,
  the Falcon cannot move to that destination.</p>

  <h3>General rules</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>It is not allowed to expose your King to check.</li>

    <li>The game is won by checkmating the opponent's King.</li>

    <li>Stalemate (no legal moves, but not in check) is a
    draw.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Differences with FIDE</h3>

  <p>The Falcon pieces are extra, and the board is expanded to
  accomodate them. To handle the larger board width, the King moves
  3 squares on castling.</p>

  <h3>Strategy issues</h3>

  <p>It is not possible to force checkmate on a bare King with just
  a single Bishop or Knight (in addition to your own King). King +
  Falcon can force mate on a bare King.</p>

  <p>Bishops are confined to squares of a single color. Having
  Bishops on both colors compensates this weakness, and is worth an
  extra 0.5 on top of their added value.</p>
