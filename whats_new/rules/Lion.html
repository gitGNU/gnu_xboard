  <h3>Pawn peculiarities</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Pawns capture differently from how they move (straight
    move, diagonal capture).</li>

    <li>Pawns can move two squares straight ahead from their
    initial position, provided they are not blocked.</li>

    <li>On the move immediately after such a double push, they can
    be captured en passant by another Pawn, as if they had only
    moved 1 square ahead.</li>

    <li>Pawns promote to another (non-royal) piece of choice when
    they reach last rank.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Castling</h3>

  <p>A King that has not moved before can move two squares in the
  direction of a Rook that has not moved before, in which case that
  Rook is moved to the square the King skipped over. This is only
  allowed if all squares between King and Rook are empty, when the
  King is not in check on the square it came from, and would not be
  in check on any of the squares it skipped over.</p>

  <h3>General rules</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>It is not allowed to expose your King to check.</li>

    <li>The game is won by checkmating the opponent's King.</li>

    <li>Stalemate (no legal moves, but not in check) is a
    draw.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The Lion piece</h3>

  <p>The Lion can make two moves per turn. That means it can also
  capture two pieces per turn, one on the square it moves to (as
  normal), and one 'en passant' on the transit square. It can also
  capture on the transit square, and move on to an empty square
  ('hit and run'), or capture and move back to where it came from
  ('shooting' the piece from a distance, as it were). Of course it
  can also capture a single piece in the normal Chess manner. In
  that case the transit square is immaterial.</p>

  <p>The Lion can make such double moves as two King steps, i.e. in
  all directions, and arbitrarily changing direction between them.
  It can also jump over the transit square, i.e. reach the distant
  two-step destination in a single jump. Finally it can also just
  make a step to an adjacent square, refraining from taking a
  second step.</p>

  <h3>Restrictions on Lion capture</h3>

  <p>There are rules to make Lion trading very difficult, in order
  to keep the Lions in play. Basically they specify that two Lions
  cannot be captured in consecutive half-moves. When the first
  capture is Lion x Lion from a distance, it is forbidden to play
  it if pseudo-legal (i.e. without taking account of check)
  recapture of the capturing Lion is possible <i>with another piece
  than King</i>. So even when the Lion is protected only with a
  pinned piece, the other Lion cannot capture it <i>from a
  distance</i>, just like a King could not capture it.</p>

  <p>When a non-Lion captures a Lion, it is just the other way
  around: then the 'counterstrike' by a non-Lion against the Lion
  is forbidden. One possibility left open is thus when you capture
  an adjacent Lion. But then you would in general be foolish to
  allow recapture, as you could take the Lion hit-and-run fashion,
  fleeing to a save square. An exception to the rule is when a
  valuable opponent piece (i.e. not a Pawn) forms a 'bridge'
  between the Lions; you may then capture that piece in the first
  leg of the double-move, and then take the opponent Lion with the
  second leg. Then the opponent can recapture, but he will have
  lost a valuable piece. In the late end-game, when you have
  nothing to protect your Lion with other than King, trading
  becomes possible.</p>

  <h3>XBoard interface issues</h3>

  <p>This game has to be played with the option Show Target Squares
  on! This option will cause marking of the target squares of any
  piece you select or grab, by the engine (with legality testing
  off) or by XBoard (legality testing on). Moving to a square
  marked in cyan will be interpreted not as the final destination,
  but as the transit square after the first step of a multi-leg
  move. XBoard will then highlight the possible destination squares
  of the second leg from there. Should you want to end on the cyan
  square, you click it again, (it will be no longer marked in
  cyan), and XBoard will terminate the move after the first leg.
  You can also move back to the starting square, to 'shoot' the
  opponent piece from nearby.</p>

  <h3>Differences with FIDE</h3>

  <p>One Knight is replaced by a Lion piece with very special
  properties.</p>

  <h3>Strategy issues</h3>

  <p>It is not possible to force checkmate on a bare King with just
  a single Bishop or Knight (in addition to your own King). Two
  Knights cannot do that either.</p>

  <p>Bishops are confined to squares of a single color. Having
  Bishops on both colors compensates this weakness, and is worth an
  extra 0.5 on top of their added value.</p>
