 <p> This version fixes some bugs found in 4.6.0. Here is a quick list of the changes: </p>

   <ul>
	<li>Fix memory corruption bug on second-engine loading (through menu or in tournament), which could destroy -firstInitString</li>
	<li>Fix bug loading a new engine through the menu (not loading it with the full game, but just upto the current move)</li>
	<li>Prefix engine command with "./" when a pathname is split up during install, so the engine actually runs (XB)</li>
	<li>Fix fall-back to -ncp mode when engine does not start (cutting short the feature timeout)</li>
	<li>Fix bug in position search for FRC castlings (where a King could 'fall off' the board)</li>
	<li>Fix bug in deriving castling rights for games with holdings after Edit Position (where Qq were never granted)</li>
	<li>Display a message informing the user how to clear the board, in sweep-select edit-position mode</li>
	<li>Fix a bug that could stop the clock when the board window was dragged (XB)</li>
	<li>Fix switching off highlighting during game (so last highlights do not remain for the rest of the game)</li>
	<li>Allow user to enter the name of a non-existing file when browsing for a save file (WB)</li>
	<li>Make sure rarely used engine-related options (such as -firstNPS) are also correctly loaded during session</li>
	<li>Correctly handle parsing of Crazyhouse promotions with legality-testing off</li>
	<li>Fix click-click detour under-promotions, which were not working for non-captures</li>
	<li>Don't strip path from engine command if directory is explicitly given in Load Engine dialog</li>
	<li>Consistently make auxiliary windows top level-shells or not, with new -topLevel option (XB)</li>
	<li>No longer fatal if second engine does not support current variant (just refuse Two Machines mode)</li>
	<li>Scroll XBoard game list to keep selected item in view (XB)</li>
	<li>Suppress spurious error popup when starting observing of bughouse games</li>
	<li>Fix vertical axis ticks in eval graph with drop games</li>
	<li>Put title on same line as menu bar only for -size 72 and larger (with -titleInWindow, XB)</li>
	<li>Properly open and close debug file when switching debug mode through key binding Ctrl-D (XB)</li>
   </ul>
